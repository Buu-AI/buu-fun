      "First the theme of the jam which is lost civilizations. But I didn't want to focus on only one lost civilization, but I wanted to use BUU AI's versatility to produce many different styles of objects and artifacts from many different civilizations. My first idea was to create some kind of Star Trek holodeck with the possibility to explore 3 to 5 different lost civilizations. But with time I decided that it would be more appropriate to make a museum of fantasy lost civilizations with more diversity",

      "The inspiration for my scene, Sunken Dwaraka: Echoes of a Lost Civilization, comes from the mythological tales of the ancient city of Dwaraka—believed to have been a divine kingdom of Lord Krishna that eventually sank beneath the sea. The imagery of an entire city swallowed by the ocean yet brimming with remnants of once-glorious architecture deeply resonated with me. I envisioned a world both serene and eerie, where broken idols, moss-covered pillars, and crumbled courtyards whisper the memory of a forgotten empire.",

      "This scene was built around a simple but atmospheric idea: a slow, upward journey through ruined stone structures toward a long-lost temple. I wanted the environment to tell the story on its own—decay, age, and quiet reverence.",
